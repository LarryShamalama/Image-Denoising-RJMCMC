# Image Segmentation using Reversible Jump MCMC

#### Final Project for MATH 598

Reversible Jump Markov Chain Monte Carlo (RJMCMC) is an extension of MCMCs which allows parameters to be sampled across different sample spaces. Introduced in [Green (1995)](https://academic.oup.com/biomet/article-abstract/82/4/711/252058), three examples of applications of the RJMCMC method are provided, one of which consists of denoising a synthesize image with random noise via Voronoi tesselation.
